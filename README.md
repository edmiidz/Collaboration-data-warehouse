# Collaboration-data-warehouse

To start, I'm going to add scripts which capture basic information about contributors and their activities. Initially I will focus on capturing data from Jive software. However I will try to make the data types and schemas generic enough so that eventually other platforms can also be merged into such a data warehouse. This cross-platform compatibility will enable the reporting of collaboration and digital transformation project ROIs, and enable community managers and collaboration architects alike to gather data and generate meaningful insights for reporting on their value propositions.

## Requirements
- Node.js
- MySQL Database
